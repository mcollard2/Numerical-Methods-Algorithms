# LU Factorization Algorithm
This function determines the LU factorization of a 3x3 matrix. The program will pivot if necessary. 

## Input and Output Descriptions:

Inputs:
1. A - square coefficient matrix

Outputs:
1. L - lower triangular matrix 
2. U - upper triangular matrix
3. P - pivot matrix

### Limitations and Known Problems:
1. This algorithm will only find the correct LU factorization for a 3x3 matrix. It will not find the LU factorization for matrices whose dimensions are nxn where n>3.
